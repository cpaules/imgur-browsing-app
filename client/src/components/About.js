        <p> This React + Redux app was developed for my final project in Flatiron School's Web Dev program. 
            It uses the Imgur API to fetch images form Imgur's "hot" section. Users can add images to their 
            favorites which are then stored using Rails API backend. Hope you enjoy my app! </p>
